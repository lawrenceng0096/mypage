<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh City currently enrolled in Linguistics as well as Computer Science degrees at RMIT Vietnam with expected graduation date in 2024. As of the moment, I possess good digital literacy skills and intermediate experiences in using Microsoft Office programs such as Word, PowerPoint, Access and Excel. I also have basic graphic editing and designing experiences using Photoshop and Autodesk Maya as well as video editing skills with Adobe Premier and Sony Vegas.</p> 

<p>Iâ€™m also a bilingual speaker with my mother tongue is Vietnamese and I had a good proficiency in English as a Second Language with an IELT score of 7.5, combined with more than 10 years of learning in a mostly English-speaking environment. For my pastime hobbies, I also try my hands at some basic web designs by creating my own web pages using Wix as well as doing graphic designs in 3D modelling for personal creative projects primarily with programs such as Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop.</p> 

<p>After graduation, I look forward to work as either a translator or a video game developer as these jobs are well-suited with the skill set I acquired throughout my years at RMIT as well as related to the pastime hobbies that I often engaged in. While I do not have much experiences in game development and maintenance on mobile platforms, I do have expectations that the company I apply will be able to assist me in acquiring new experiences and skills in fulfilling the requirements that the job required.</p>
